# Project_Personal_CATF_2022
With our "Mak'Hack" CTF team, we created a Christmas-themed CTF. Every day, from December 1 to 24, one or more challenges were put online like an Advent calendar (hence the name). The categories present were: Cryptography, Miscellaneous, OSINT, Programming, Network, Reverse, Steganography, System and Web. I am also fully occupied with the OSINT and steganography categories but also offer 3 programming challenges. This CTF was in partnership with Cr√©dit Agricole Technologies et Services and brought together 280 players.

This repository is only my challenges, so not all challenges of the CTF are here.
